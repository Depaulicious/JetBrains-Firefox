# JetBrains Toolbox Extension for Firefox

This is exactly the same source of the [official Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-toolbox-extensi/offnedcbhjldheanlbojaefbfbllddna), with some changes in the manifest to make it work in Firefox.

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Go to `about:debugging`
- Load it as a temporary extension

It requires a new Firefox version with WebExtensions support.
